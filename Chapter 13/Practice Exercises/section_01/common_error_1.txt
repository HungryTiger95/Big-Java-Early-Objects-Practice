Infinite Recursion

A common programming error is an infinite recursion: a method calling itself over an over
with no end in sight. The computer needs some amount of memory for bookkeeping for each
call. After some number of calls, all memory that is available for this purpose is exhausted.
Your program shuts down and reports a "stack overflow".

Infinite recursion happens either because the arguments don't get simpler or because a
special terminating case is missing. For example, suppose the getArea method was allowed to
compute the area of a triangle with width 0. If it weren't for the special test, the method would
construct triangles with width -1, -2, -3, and so on.
