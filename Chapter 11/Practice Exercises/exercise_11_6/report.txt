This course builds on the writing principles and processes practiced in COCC150.
COCC300 focuses on reading and writing a range of arguments appropriate for academic
and general audiences. This course offers students multiple opportunities to both read
and analyze varieties of argumentation and to research, write, and revise their own arguments
on controversial issues. Students will complete a carefully sequenced series of assignments
that will include summarizing, synthesizing, evaluating, and crafting arguments, many of which
will be based on library and field research.
