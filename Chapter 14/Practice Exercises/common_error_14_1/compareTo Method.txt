The call a.compareTo(b) is allowed to return any negative integer
to denote that a should come before b, not necessarily the value -1.
That is, the test

		if(a.compareTo(b) == -1) // ERROR!
		
is generally wrong. Instead, you should test

		if(a.compareTo(b) < 0) // OK
		
Sometimes it is convenient to just return the difference of two
integers. For example, the compareTo method of the String class
compares characters matching positions:

		char c1 = charAt(i);
		char c2 = other.charAt(i);
		
If the characters are different, then the method simply returns
their difference:

		if(c1 != 2)
		{
			return c1 - c2;
		}
		
This difference is a negative number if c1 is less than c2, but it
is not necessarily the number -1.
