As of Java 5, the Comparable interface is a parameterized type, similar
to the ArrayList type.

		public interface Comparable<T>
		{
			int compareTo(T other);
		}
		
The type parameter specifies the type of the objects that this class is
willing to accept for comparison. Usually, this type is the same as the
class type itself. For example, the Country class would implement
Comparable<Country>, like this:

		public class Country implements Comparable<Country>
		{
			...
			public int compareTo(Country other)
			{
				if(area < other.area)
				{
					return -1;
				}
				else if(area == other.area)
				{
					return 0;
				}
				else
				{
					return 1;
				}
			}
		}
		
The type parameter has a significant advantage. You need not use a cast
to convert an Object parameter variable into the desired type.
