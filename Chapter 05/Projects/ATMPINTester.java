/**
 * Business P5.9
 * 
 * When you use an automated teller machine with your bank card, you need
 * to use a PIN to access your account. If a user fails more than three
 * times when entering the PIN, the machine will block the card. Assume
 * that the user's PIN is "1234" and write a program that asks the user for
 * the PIN no more than three times, and does the following:
 * 
 * 		* If the user enters the right number, print a message saying
 * 		  "Your PIN is correct", and end the program
 * 
 * 		* If the user enters the wrong number, print a message saying "Your
 * 		  PIN is incorrect" and, if you have asked for the PIN less than three times, ask for it again.
 * 
 * 		* If the user enters a wrong number three times, print a message saying
 * 		  "Your bank card is blocked" and end the program
