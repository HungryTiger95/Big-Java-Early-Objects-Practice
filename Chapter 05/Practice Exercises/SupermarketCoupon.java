 * A supermarket awards coupons depending on how much a customer spends on
 * groceries. For example, if you spend 50 dollars, you will get a coupon worth eight percent
 * of that amount. The following table shows the percent used to calculate the coupon awarded
 * for different amounts spent. Write a program that calculates and prints the value of the
 * coupon a person can receive based on groceries purchased.
 * 
 *  +----------------------------------------------+
 * 	|	Money Spent				Coupon Percentage  |
 *  +----------------------------------------------+
 *  |	Less than 10			   No coupon	   |
 *  |	From 10 - 60				  8%		   |
 *  |	From 60 - 150                 10%          |
 *  |	From 150 - 210                12%          |
 *  |	More than 210                 18%          |
