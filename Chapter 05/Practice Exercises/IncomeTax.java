/**
 * E5.17
 * 
 * The original U.S. income tax of 1913 was quite simple. The tax was:
 * 
 * 		* 1 percent on the first 50,000
 * 		* 2 percent on the amount over 50,000 up to 75,000
 * 		* 3 percent on the amount over 75,000 up to 100,000
 * 		* 4 percent on the amount over 100,00 up to 250,000
 * 		* 5 percent on the amount over 250,000 up to 500,000
 * 		* 6 percent on the amount over 500,000
 * 
 * There was no separate schedule for single or married taxpayers. Write a program that
 * computes the income tax according to the schedule.
